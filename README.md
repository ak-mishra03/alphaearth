## 🚀 **Goals & Motivation**

Insurance is meant to protect people and businesses when disaster strikes — but most of the industry still relies on **slow paperwork, manual verification, and outdated data**.

With the rise of models like **Google DeepMind’s AlphaEarth**, satellite imagery and AI can now track global environmental changes in real time.  
**Earth Claim Vision** builds on this idea — combining satellite feeds, climate data, and ML models to:

- Predict disaster risks before they happen  
- Detect damage from space in near real-time  
- Estimate insurance claim values instantly  
- Automate payouts and reduce fraud

## 💡 **Problem Statement**

Today’s insurance systems struggle with:
- Manual damage assessment after floods, fires, or storms  
- Delays in claims processing and payouts  
- Inaccurate or outdated risk predictions  
- Limited integration of geospatial and AI data  

**Earth Claim Vision** addresses these pain points by bringing **real-time AI-driven insights** into insurance workflows.
